            The Most Hon. Andrew Holness, O.N., M.P.,
            <br />Prime Minister
            <br />Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation
          </h3>
          <hr />

          <p>
            <strong>The Most Honourable Andrew Michael Holness</strong> was first elected as Member of
            Parliament (MP) to represent the Constituency of West Central St. Andrew in
            1997, at the age of 25. Now in his fourth consecutive term as MP, Mr. Holness
            became Jamaica’s ninth Prime Minister after the Jamaica Labour Party defeated
            the People’s National Party at the polls on February 25, 2016. Mr. Holness has
            pledged to build real partnerships with the Private Sector, Civil Society,
            the Diaspora, the Opposition and International Partners in order to achieve
            the vision of shared prosperity for all Jamaicans through inclusive economic
            growth and meaningful job creation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mr. Holness first served as Head of Government from October 2011 to January
            2012 having succeeded former Prime Minister the Honourable Bruce Golding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prior to assuming the awesome responsibility of leading the nation,
            Mr. Holness has worked steadily at various levels of the
            political and governance systems. He has focused on several key portfolios
            areas including: social welfare, community development, housing and education.
            However, it is in the area of Education that
            Mr. Holness found his passion and distinguished himself both as the Opposition
            Spokesperson on Education and in the Cabinet as Minister of Education.
          </p>

          <p>
            He brought national attention and focus to literacy and has instituted several
            programmes to place Jamaica on the path to universal literacy at the primary
            level. Under his watch, Jamaica saw the introduction of the Career Advancement
            Programme (CAP) – a post-secondary technical and vocational training programme
            for unattached youth. However, some of Mr. Holness’ more fundamental reforms to
            the Education System include: the establishment of institutions such as the
            Jamaica Teaching Council, the National Education Trust, the National Education
            Inspectorate, National College for Education Leadership, the Centres of Excellence
            Programme and the Alternative Secondary Transition Education Programme (ASTEP)
            designed to support students falling behind in general education.

            With a Master of Science in Development Studies and a Bachelor of Science in
            Management Studies from the University of the West Indies (Mona Campus),
            Mr. Holness brings a vibrant, pragmatic energy to the transformation of
            Public Sector Administration and to making Government more agile and responsive.
            The focus of his Government is to grow the economy, create jobs and improve
            the well-being of the Jamaican people.

            Mr. Holness was born to working class parents on July 22, 1972
