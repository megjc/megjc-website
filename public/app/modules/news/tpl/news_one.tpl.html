      KINGSTON, Jamaica- The Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation today
      (December 19, 2016) signed a Joint Venture Agreement valued at
      approximately $1,116,000,000.00 with West Indies Home Contractors (WIHCON)
       to develop 96 housing solutions in Harbour Head, Harbour View, St. Andrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr Horace Chang, Minister with responsibility for Water, Works & Housing in the
      Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation in signing the contract commended
      the partnership.
    </p>

<p>
  “We recognize that we do not have the resources to meet the housing demand and
  as such, one of the strategies of this administration is to utilize public
  private partnerships such as this for housing solutions,” he noted.
</p>

<p>
  Under the Joint Venture Agreement, 20 residents from Caribbean Terrace whose
  homes were destroyed following the passage of Hurricanes Ivan and Dean in 2004
  and 2007 stand to benefit from a subsidy provided by the government should they
  decide to purchase a unit in the development.
</p>

<p>
  Member of Parliament for East Rural St. Andrew, Juliet Holness in whose
  constituency the development will take place applauded the project and
  noted that the impending development was welcome news. Mrs Holness commented
  that there are skilled labourers in her constituency in need of jobs and this
  development will provide the necessary employment.
