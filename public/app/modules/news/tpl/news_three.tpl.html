    <p>
      Approximately 150 National Water Commission (NWC) personnel will undergo training and capacity building to improve water supply within the Kingston and St. Andrew area.
    </p>
    <p>
      This follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) this week (February 14) among the NWC, HEART Trust/NTA and Miya Jamaica for the Kingston and St. Andrew Non- Revenue Water Co- Management Project.
    </p>

<p>
  Speaking at the signing, Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, Dr. Horace Chang said “this is a good example of joined up government that will significantly boost productivity, efficiency and reliability in the water sector.”
</p>

<p>
  Minister Chang said the training will result in a dedicated team to tackle the issue of Non-Revenue Water (NRW), as certification programmes are implemented for the NWC staff.
</p>

<p>
  The project is part of the Kingston Metropolitan Area Water Supply Improvement Programme, financed by the Inter-American Development Bank. It focuses on the rehabilitation of key water production facilities and reduction of NRW within the Kingston and St. Andrew Area.
</p>
<p>
  The government is forecasting a steady reduction in NRW, from 53% to 20% at the end of the five year project.
