          <br />Director General
        </h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Since August 2012, Sharon Alicia Marie Crooks, with a sharp focus and quiet
          efficiency, has taken on the arduous task as the Director General at the
          Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation.
          Prior to her appointment as Director General,
          Dr. Crooks served as Permanent Secretary of the
          Ministry of Local Government and Community Development (2011 to 2012) and
          Financial Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service (2008 to 2009).
          Between those years, Dr. Crooks was selected to serve the Caribbean Region as
          the Caribbean Advisor to The World Bank Board of Governors in Washington DC,
          U.S.A (2009 to 2011). Dr. Crooks has also served as a Board Official for the
          Central Bank of Jamaica and as a member of the Jamaica Fiscal Responsibility
          Monitoring High-Level Team, responsible for the effective management of the
          public debt and the monitoring of the financial regulatory systems.
          The relatively youthful but vastly experienced and highly qualified public
           servant is a graduate from the University of Technology (Accounts and Economics)
           with a Doctorate in Organizational Leadership and a Master of Business
           Administration from the Nova Southeastern University, Florida in the United States.
           Dr. Crooks also holds Certification in Finance for Macroeconomists from the IMF,
           Washington DC, USA; Certification in Fraud Examination (CFE) from the Association
           of Certified Fraud Examiners, Texas, USA; and Revenue Agent Certification from
           the Tax Administration Jamaica.
