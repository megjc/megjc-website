      Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation,
      Hon. Daryl Vaz,  has stated that while the Government is pursuing its economic
      (‘5 in 4’) growth targets, it is mindful that the quality of life for all
      Jamaicans is linked to the quality of the natural environment.

      In his remarks delivered by, Mr. Locksley Smith,  Senior Advisor in the Ministry of
      Economic Growth and Job Creation, at the 24th Anniversary celebrations of the Blue
      and John Crow Mountains as a National Park, Minister Vaz  gave the assurance that
      the government cannot allow adverse environmental impacts and climate change to
      disrupt  the lives of Jamaicans.
    </p>

<p>
  As such, we intend to increase our efforts to pursue long term transformative
   development and accelerate sustainable climate –resilient economic growth”
   the Minister said.

  The Minister noted that  in addition to the Blue and John Crow Mountains
  National Park, Jamaica has three Marine Parks and more than 200 protected
  areas, which include natural forest reserves and fish sanctuaries, all of
  which must be managed sustainably in order to enhance the quality of life for
  Jamaicans..

<p>
  ‘My Ministry and our agency, the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA), are currently finalizing a Protected Areas Policy and overarching legislation for the management of the protected areas system network”, the Minister said.
</p>
<p>
  He added that the draft National Forest Management and Conservation Plan (2016-2026) was recently completed and is currently being discussed in islandwide public consultations, adding  that  twelve (12) additional forest reserves are to be declared shortly.

  In pledging the Government’s co-operation with all environmental stakeholders, Minister Vaz thanked Dr. Susan Otuokan and her team at the Jamaica Conservation Development Trust (JCDT) for their efforts in preserving and conserving the Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park and in raising awareness about the value of the Park to all Jamaicans.
